# AirBnB_clone (The Hollberton B&B)

Overview
_________
In this project, i build my first web application which is basically the clone of the *[AirBnB](airbnb.com "AirBnb Website")* website.
The project consists of 
* Creation of a **command interpreter** that will help create and manage objects
* The front-end part that the user interacts with. (HTML/CSS)
* A database
* An API through which the U.I and storage engine will communicate

This project will be done in the course of 4 months. Step by step, begining with the console.

#Console
In this stage, i will be building a console (command interpreter) that will help create and manage objects 
that will be used across the project.
It will:
* Help create a new object
* Help retrieve an object from a file or database
* Do an operation of the object like counting and computing stats
* Update attributes
* Destroy an object
We will be manipulating a powerful storage system that will be giving an abstraction. Through the console, 
we wont have to pay attention to how objects are stored. One can also change the storage  type easily 
without changing the code base.
